[![GitHub Marketplace](https://img.shields.io/badge/Marketplace-Smart%20AI%20Code%20Review-blue.svg?colorA=24292e&colorB=0366d6&style=flat&longCache=true&logo=github)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/smart-ai-code-review-action)

An intelligent GitHub Action that provides automated, AI-powered code reviews on your pull requests. It features a resilient fallback system, visual summaries, and smart diff analysis to deliver professional-grade feedback.

## Key Features

-   📊 **Visual PR Summary**: Each review starts with a Mermaid sequence diagram summarizing the changes.
-   🧠 **Intelligent Diff Analysis**: Automatically prioritizes critical files in large pull requests to stay within token limits.
-   🔄 **Resilient Fallback System**: If the primary GitHub Models API fails, it seamlessly switches to a self-hosted Ollama model.
-   🤖 **Multi-Provider Support**: Natively supports GitHub Models and any model compatible with Ollama.
-   ✅ **Comprehensive Reviews**: Analyzes code for security, performance, best practices, and style.
-   🚀 **Zero-Setup Ready**: Works out of the box with the standard `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## Usage

### Workflow Permissions

This action requires the following permissions in your workflow file to read code and post comments.

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
```

### Basic Example

This configuration uses the default settings and is the quickest way to get started. Create a file like `.github/workflows/code-review.yml`:

```yaml
name: KeployAI Code Review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  ai-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0 # Required to get the full git history for diffing

      - name: Run Smart AI Code Review
        uses: euclidstellar/code-review-agent@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
```

### Advanced Example

This configuration customizes the models, temperature, and file patterns.

```yaml
name: Advanced KeployAI Code Review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  ai-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Run Smart AI Code Review
        uses: euclidstellar/code-review-agent@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
          model: 'gpt-4o'
          ollama-model: 'gemma3n:e4b'
          temperature: 0.1
          ignore-patterns: '*.md,*.lock,dist/**'
